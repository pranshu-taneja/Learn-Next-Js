//ðŸ‘‡THese might not reflect as visual changes as these are related to performance rather than the data that is being rendered on the page
// Now you can use it to get all the data rather tahn the links provided on the page.
// Be careful while experimenting with the code below cuz it might also happen sometimes that the data might get served from the pages who redirected you to this one page (Maybe i built this functionality in those page accidently). You will recognize this on refreshing this dynamic page after being redirected.(break the code of gsp for this) --> (Although its working fine right now)

export const getStaticProps = async (ctx) => {                  // This will get the data on buildtime and will save it.
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${ctx.params.id}`);

      data

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {             // This is the method to get the paths of the pages that we want to generate dynamically but only on buildtime

  const data = await res.json();
  const id = data.map((data)=>data.id);
  const paths = id.map((id)=>({params:{id:id.toString()}}));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback:false
  }
}

//Important thing to know about get static path and get static props working (ofc they work together)
// 1. getStaticPaths is used to get the paths of the pages that we want to generate dynamically
// 2. getStaticProps is used to get the data of the page that we want to generate dynamically
// 3. So in the meantime/buildtime getStaticPaths will get the paths and generate id's whichever possible as according the API and getStaticProps will call the api for each id generated and fetch the data as per its defination/functionaltiy and get the data for each id and will serve later on being requested by user as a static page. SO that everything remains static.
